# Project10OC
10th project of Python courses from OpenClassrooms

# What's new
This project is basically a copy of the 8th, already on GitHub, except this one has been modified to be upload on DigitalOcean (and not Heroku), as well as implementing few other stuff (Travis, Sentry ....). For a better understanding of the evolution of source code, please look at the 8th project repository.
